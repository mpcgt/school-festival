# Creation of a web page for the Music Festival

This repository is an exercise on these HTML/CSS languages in my school, the exercise is **Creation of a web page for the Music Festival** and it is now finished.

_The aim of this exercise is to add video, audio and iframe tags._

What I need to do in this exercise: 
1. Integrate a promotional video of the festival using the ```<video>``` tag.
2. Embed an audio clip of a participating artist using the ```<audio>``` tag.
3. Include a map showing the festival's location using a ```<iframe>``` tag.
4. Create a contact form for visitors to ask questions and style it using CSS.

_Summary: Design a complete web page to promote the “Harmonie des Sons” music festival using HTML and CSS. This exercise will enable you to put into practice the use of video and audio tags, CSS pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements, while respecting basic HTML semantics. You'll also integrate a map via an iframe and style a form._
